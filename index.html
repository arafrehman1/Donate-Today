                    nutrition; it’s also a means of communicating love. Yet, for low-income parents, meals tend to
                    involve fast food and processed snacks.

                    the break-up of families. A number of studies have documented that children in families who
                    experience homelessness frequently become separated from their parents. </h6>

                    succeed both academically and socially in a school environment. It requires physical well-being and
